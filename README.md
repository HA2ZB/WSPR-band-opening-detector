# WSPR UDP Watcher with GPIO LED (Orange Pi)

This is the "twin project" of **FT8-band-opening-detector** (https://github.com/HA2ZB/FT8-band-opening-detector).

This project monitors **WSJT-X WSPR decodes via UDP**, classifies stations as **DX / non-DX** using a configurable distance parameter, and provides:

- **Visual indication via GPIO LED**
  - steady ON while DX activity is present
  - periodic heartbeat blink while idle
- **CSV logging** of DX-related decodes
- **Headless / semi-headless operation**, suitable for Orange Pi / Raspberry Pi class systems

The design assumes **receive-only WSPR monitoring** using an RTL-SDR + SpyVerter, with WSJT-X running over VNC.

The primary target was to continuously monitor the "magic" 6-meter band for Es openings.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Orange Pi (tested on Orange Pi 4A)
- RTL-SDR dongle
- SpyVerter (or equivalent HF upconverter)
- GPIO-connected LED (example: PI6 → GPIO line 262)

### Software
- Linux with PulseAudio (Orange Pi 1.0.4 Jammy with Linux 5.15.147-sun55iw3)
- Python 3.9+
- WSJT-X
- rtl-sdr
- sox
- libgpiod + python3-gpiod

---

## Installing dependencies (example)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  wsjtx \
  rtl-sdr \
  sox \
  pulseaudio \
  python3-yaml \
  python3-gpiod
```

---

## Starting WSJT-X via VNC

WSJT-X is started with its GUI exported over VNC:

```bash
wsjtx -platform vnc &
```

Connect using any VNC viewer from another machine.

---

## WSJT-X configuration (important)

Inside the WSJT-X GUI (via VNC):

### 1. Audio
- **Input**: PulseAudio
- **Device**: `WSJTX_SINK`

### 2. Mode and band
- Mode: **WSPR**
- Band: must match the actually received band (e.g. 20 m = 14.074 MHz)

### 3. Reporting → UDP server
- Enable **UDP Server**
- Address: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `2237` (must match `config.yaml`)
- Accept UDP requests: **enabled**

WSJT-X continuously sends:
- *Status packets* (including dial frequency)
- *Decode packets* (WSPR messages)

These packets are consumed by `wspr8watch_udp.py`.

---

## Creating the PulseAudio audio sink

WSJT-X does not read audio directly from `rtl_sdr`.  
Instead, a **virtual PulseAudio null sink** is used.

```bash
pactl load-module module-null-sink \
  sink_name=wsjtx_sink \
  sink_properties=device.description=WSJTX_SINK
```

This creates a sink named `wsjtx_sink`, which WSJT-X uses as its audio input.

---

## Starting the radio / SDR audio chain

Example for **6 m WSPR (50.293 MHz)** using a SpyVerter:

```bash
sudo rtl_biast -b 1

HF_KHZ=50293
LO_KHZ=120000
FS=1200000
TUNE_HZ=$(( (HF_KHZ + LO_KHZ) * 1000 ))

rtl_sdr -f ${TUNE_HZ} -s ${FS} -g 22 - | \
sox -t raw -r 1200000 -e unsigned -b 8 -c 2 - \
    -t raw -r 12000 -e signed -b 16 -c 1 - | \
pacat --raw --format=s16le --rate=12000 --channels=1 --device=wsjtx_sink
```

Explanation:
- `rtl_biast -b 1` enables Bias-T power for the SpyVerter
- `rtl_sdr` captures I/Q samples
- `sox` converts raw I/Q to 12 kHz audio
- `pacat` feeds the audio into the PulseAudio sink

At this point:
- WSJT-X should show a waterfall
- WSPR decodes should appear in the WSJT-X window

---

## Running the WSPR UDP watcher

```bash
sudo python3 wsprwatch_udp.py /home/orangepi/WSPR/config.yaml
```

On startup the script prints:
- parsed configuration
- GPIO mapping
- UDP bind address

During operation:
- WSPR decodes are printed to the console
- DX lines are highlighted
- LED state reflects DX / idle status

---

## LED behavior

- **DX detected**
  - LED is turned ON
  - stays ON for `dx_hold_minutes` after the last DX decode
- **No DX**
  - LED blinks periodically as a heartbeat
  - controlled by `heartbeat_every_seconds` and `heartbeat_on_seconds`

This allows quick visual indication of band openings without watching the screen.

---

## CSV logging

DX-related decodes are appended to:

```
/home/orangepi/WSPR/wspr_dx_log.csv
```

CSV format:

```
timestamp_utc,freq_hz,sender_callsign,grid,snr,raw_line
```

The file can be safely monitored while the script is running:

```bash
tail -f /home/orangepi/WSPR/wspr_dx_log.csv
```

Reading the file does **not** interfere with logging.

---

## GPIO notes (Orange Pi example)

- Logical port: `PI6`
- Resolved internally to **GPIO line 262**
- Uses `libgpiod` (not legacy sysfs GPIO)

Polarity is configurable in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
gpio:
  active_high: true
```
LED is connected to `PI6` with a 5k resistor to GND.

---

## Notes and limitations

- DX classification is **distance-based**, using the decoded grid information
- Dial frequency is taken from WSJT-X status packets  
  (ensure the WSJT-X band matches the actual manually tuned band)

This setup is intentionally modular and transparent, making it easy to adapt to:
- different bands
- different SDR front-ends
- alternative alerting mechanisms
